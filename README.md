# Thesis-Research
This respository contains the code and configuration files used to implement and test an inverse lighting method for augmented reality described in my master's thesis, "Real-Time Inverse Lighting for Augmented Reality Using a Dodecahedral Marker".

This repository does not include any executables or any of the third party libraries I made use of.  If you wish to compile this code yourself, you will need the following A.P.I.s:
 
 • GLEW
 
 • GLUT (it's a long story)
 
 • GLM
 
 • ARToolkit 5
 
 • YAML-CPP
